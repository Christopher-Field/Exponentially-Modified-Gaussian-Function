Documentation of Special Test 12 Processing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ST12 was a very complex program to perform all of the processing steps required by
I&T Special Test 12. It has several sub-commands, one for each processing step.
Most of the python code has been removed to focus on the doc strings.
